      <h1>Our Beliefs</h1>
      <p>Seventh Day Baptists consider liberty of thought under the guidance of
         the Holy Spirit to be essential to Christian belief and practice. Therefore
          we encourage the unhindered study and open discussion of Scripture. 
          We uphold the individual’s freedom of conscience in seeking to determine 
          and obey the will of God. The following statement is not intended to be 
          exhaustive, but is an expression of our common belief, which is derived 
          from our understanding of Scripture. 2 Corinthians 3:17-18; 2 
        Timothy 2:15; Romans 12:2; Ephesians 4:3-6, 15; Romans 10:17; 2 Timothy 3:16-17</p>

    <div class="info_about_us">
      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p> Our mission as a church comes from the Great Commission of Jesus Christ who commanded us to “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.” (Matthew 28: 16-20)</p>
