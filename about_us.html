      <h1>Our Beliefs</h1>
      <p>Seventh Day Baptists consider liberty of thought under the guidance of
        the Holy Spirit to be essential to Christian belief and practice. Therefore
        we encourage the unhindered study and open discussion of Scripture.
        We uphold the individual's freedom of conscience in seeking to determine
        and obey the will of God. The following statement is not intended to be
        exhaustive, but is an expression of our common belief, which is derived
        from our understanding of Scripture.

      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p> Our mission as a church comes from the Great
        Commission of Jesus Christ who commanded us to “go and make
        disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father
        and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey
        everything I have commanded you.” </p>

      <p>Seventh Day Baptists in Malawi are part of the worldwide church found in North America, South America, Europe,
        Australia, New Zealand and Asia. In Malawi, we are administratively known as Central Africa Conference of
        Seventh Day Baptists (CAC of SDB) because our global family is organized in Conferences.
        The CAC is one the 20 Conferences present in 6 continents across the world.<br><br>
        The CAC is headed by the Board of Trustees, which is elected at the general assembly of the church. The Board is
        led by the Chairperson of the Board who also becomes the President of the CAC. The Secretariat of the Board is
        led by the General Secretary (GS).<br><br>
        Currently, the President of the CAC and Board Chairperson is Dr. Elias Ngalande who himself is the former
        Reserve Bank Governor, Secretary to Treasury and Senior Lecturer in Economics at the University of Malawi. The
        current General Secretary is Pastor Charles Stima.<br><br>
        Malawi has the highest population of Christians in the SDB membership of all conferences in the world. The
        headquarters of CAC is based at Naperi in Blantyre after Makapwa which has been our traditional meeting point as
        a Conference.<br><br>
        The CAC has a long history of providing social services in health and education particularly to remote and
        difficult to access areas of Malawi where services are most needed. We have established health centers and
        clinics at Makapwa, Chipho and Thomas in Thyolo; Thembe in Mulanje as well as Dunduzu in Mzuzu, which
        temporarily closed.<br>
