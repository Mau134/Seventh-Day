        <h1>History.</h1>
        <p>“Unity in Christ and a vigorous witness throughout the world” - That was the broad goal stated by the
          founders of the SDB World Federation in 1964.
          Representatives from seven countries responded to the invitation from the United States conference to meet
          with them in 1964 to discuss missionary effort and cooperation on a global scale. They drafted a constitution
          to be submitted to the national conferences and groups who might be interested in joining. By the end of the
          following year
          (1965) eleven groups had become charter members of the new federation.

        <h1>Purpose.</h1>
        <p>Since the beginning the purposes of the international body remain essentially the same:
          1. To provide increased communication among Seventh Day Baptist groups around the world. 2. To promote
          projects for mutual interest which will benefit from international cooperation.
          3. To stimulate fellowship among Seventh Day Baptist Christians.

        <h1>Publications.</h1>
        <p>An annual Week of Prayer sponsored by the Federation promotes unity of
          Christian spirit among all Seventh Day Baptists each January. The published prayer booklet, written by someone
          from a different country each year, is translated into several languages. The Federation newsletter, Seventh
          Day Baptist
          World, highlights Federation activities and news from member groups.

        <h1>Projects.</h1>
        <p>Projects supported by the Federation have included leadership education programs or publishing in specific
          countries, travel funding for evangelistic missions within or between countries, disaster relief through
          member groups, and sending of officers or “ambassadors” to encourage the growth of work in new and existing
          locations. Money for projects comes through voluntary contributions from member conferences and individuals as
          they respond to a need that is communicated.
